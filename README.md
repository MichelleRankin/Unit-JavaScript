# Unit-JavaScript-MiniMinecraft

This was my Unit 6 Project, I took inspiration from my favorite game, and utilized promises, functions, for loops, and different frameworks to help make this project possible.

## Using Tutorials, and Frameworks
I used 3 different libraries, Perlin noise, Three.js, and PointerLockControls, all of which helped define the camera angle, and create this 3D version of Minecraft. 

## For reference 
I used the youtube tutorial created by Hritic RC, followed along and researched different ways to create Minecraft, and this was the result.
